# SQL-Project
Description:
>This SQL project focuses on analyzing international COVID-19 statistics for the years 2020 and 2021.

## Project Overview
#### Motivation
>This project aims to leverage SQL and data analysis techniques to examine key COVID-19 statistics from 2020 and 2021, including case counts, deaths, and vaccination rates. By filtering and querying large datasets, this analysis seeks to uncover valuable insights into the global distribution of the virus, the effectiveness of public health measures, and the relationship between vaccination rates and infection trends.
#### Features
>The queries used in this project are designed to explore various connections between key COVID-19 metrics.
>>By comparing Total COVID cases vs. Total Deaths, the likelihood of death upon contraction is analyzed.
>>Queries also examine the percentage of the population contracted by COVID
>>Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population, and ranks continents by the highest death count, helping to reveal patterns and disparities in the impact of the pandemic globally.
